# B-RollEditor

# Motivation
Searching through hours of B-roll footage (supplementary or alternative footage) and then aligning the footage with a particular sound track is a tedious task. We want to explore options that can help automate this video editing process as well as provide a clean and intuitive framework to help a user edit video footage. 

# Project Description
The main feature of our application will take in a series of video footages and a sound track, then the application will automate the editing process to align video cuts with music changes. 

# Features
Another feature we would like to include is being able to detect speaking and non-speaking parts of a video and auto adjust the soundtrack volume to match each part. (So thinking of a vlog style video format). 

Additional features may include provided a platform to edit the soundtrack volume or additional, manual drag-n-drop features similar to iMovie and other video editing software. 

# Teams
Front end/UI team
Clean/Intuitive UI’s (starting with wireframing
Easy way to view final product on web application

Backend/Server Team
Create scripts for manipulating video and sound clips

Potentially a Database Team as well

# Technologies 
## Frontend
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, (We could look into React or Angular if the frontend team would like to work on that) 
JQuery

## Backend
Node.js 
Python 
Libraries used to manipulate sound / video 
If we want a database - let’s look into Heroku and Postgresql 

# Outline:
## Week 4
Front end team draws out some wire frames 
Backend and server team get a server up and running/connected to the front end
Research what type of technologies can implement sound manipulation / video editing

## Week 5
Front end team creates a menu for input (mainly will be based on the wire frames)
Backend team - implement starter scripts to manipulate video and sound. Try and see if we can find the heavy beat clips for music (ie every 8 counts) 
Any updates can be addressed later
